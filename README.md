# PCB

The latest PCB revision that has been produced and tested is rev. 0. However,
there is an error in that version: Rx and Tx are swapped (of course!) on the
USB side. That can be fixed with a bodge, but later commits fix that mistake
without making functional changes.

# Firmware

The latest firmware version that has been tested is 0.1.0.0. There are no known
issues.
